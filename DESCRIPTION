Description: Implements random  number generation, plotting, and estimation algorithms for the two-parameter one-sided and two-sided M-Wright (Mainardi-Wright) family.
             The M-Wright  distributions naturally generalize the widely used one-sided (Airy and half-normal or half-Gaussian) and symmetric (Airy and Gaussian or normal) models. 
             These are widely studied in time-fractional differential equations.
